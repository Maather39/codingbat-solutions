📘 CodingBat Java Solutions
This repository contains my complete Java solutions for all CodingBat practice problems. Each problem is implemented and committed following best practices in version control and clean code principles.

📁 Folder Structure
Each solution is:

Written in its own Java class

Organized by topic/category (e.g., warmup1, array2, recursion1, etc.)

Clearly committed with meaningful messages

Pushed using the Git feature-branch workflow (branch → commit → pull request → merge)

✅ Submission Workflow
Chose a problem from CodingBat Java

Solved the problem on the platform until all test cases passed

Created a feature branch:
git checkout -b warmup1-sleepIn

Added the solution to the correct folder and Java file

Committed with a clear message:
git commit -m "Add solution for warmup1-sleepIn"

Pushed the branch and opened a Pull Request

Merged the solution to the main branch after review

Repeated the same process for each problem

💡 This repository is part of my Java learning journey and showcases my problem-solving skills using clean and organized code.
