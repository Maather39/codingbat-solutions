## 📘 CodingBat Java Solutions

This repository contains **my complete Java solutions** for all CodingBat practice problems. Each problem is implemented and committed following best practices in version control and clean code principles.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

Each solution is:

* Written in its own Java class
* Organized by topic/category (e.g., `warmup1`, `array2`, `recursion1`, etc.)
* Clearly committed with meaningful messages
* Pushed using the Git feature-branch workflow (branch → commit → pull request → merge)

---

### ✅ Submission Workflow

1. Chose a problem from [CodingBat Java](https://codingbat.com/java)
2. Solved the problem on the platform until all test cases passed
3. Created a feature branch:
   `git checkout -b warmup1-sleepIn`
4. Added the solution to the correct folder and Java file
5. Committed with a clear message:
   `git commit -m "Add solution for warmup1-sleepIn"`
6. Pushed the branch and opened a Pull Request
7. Merged the solution to the main branch after review
8. Repeated the same process for each problem
