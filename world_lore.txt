**Ancient Runes**  
The language of Ancient Runes predates all known civilizations. Each symbol carries not only meaning but magical resonance. Only trained Chronomancers can read them, using special ink and rituals. Misreading a rune could shift time itself, unraveling days or centuries in a blink.

**The Griffin**  
The Griffin is a legendary creature guarding the Sky Peaks. With the body of a lion and wings of an eagle, it soars through mountain storms. Known to sense truth, it allows only the worthy to pass. It nests near sacred crystals that amplify magical power.
